    <p>Code for SA is a civic technology lab. Everything we do is open source and often draws public attention. You’ll get to work on a wide variety of projects which keeps it interesting and means there’s lots to learn. We’re a small team so you can get your hands dirty in almost everything we do and there are opportunities to travel to talk about what we do both locally and internationally.</p>

    <p>
    We're based in <a href="http://www.codebridge.co.za/">Codebridge</a> in beautiful Cape Town and have flexible working conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
    We use industry best practices and technologies, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Python, Django and Flask</li>
      <li>GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/Code4SA/">github.com/Code4SA</a></li>
      <li>Heroku, Amazon EC2, S3 and RDS</li>
      <li>Agile processes using Trello and Pivotal Tracker</li>
      <li>Bootstrap, D3, Leaflet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    You should be familiar with the technology stack we use (or keen to learn) and have 2-3 years experience under your belt.
    </p>

    <p>
    Most of all, you should want to make a difference to your city and South Africa. Come and join us!
