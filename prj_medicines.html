    <h5>For People</h5>
    <p> What should your medicines cost? We created a <a href="http://mpr.code4sa.org/" title="What should your medicines cost?" target="_blank">medicines price registry</a> that allows anyone to quickly and easily look up what they should be paying for their medicine as well as view generic alternatives. </p>
    <h5>For Governments</h5>
    <p>In a 2010 study of medicine prices for a basket of 50 essential medicines in the Southern African Development Community Region (SADC), it was found that the ratio between the most expensive and the cheapest prices for the same medicines was over 5. This means that one country pays 5 times more than another, for same medicine. In some cases, the ratio was over 50. </p>
    
    <p>In partnership with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the <a href="http://www.sarpam.net/" title="The Southern Africa Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostics" target="_blank">The Southern Africa Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostics</a> (SARPAM) we currently developing an application that allows governments to view and share information on medicine prices, suppliers and quantities.</p>
    
    <h5>For Communities</h5>
    <p>The Tendai project, part of the <a href="http://www.sarpam.net/" title="The Southern Africa Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostics" target="_blank">The Southern Africa Regional Programme on Access to Medicines and Diagnostics</a> (SARPAM), partners with civil society organisations in 5 countries to monitor availability of medicines.
