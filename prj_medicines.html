    <p>Social networking, comparative shopping and rating systems are part of our modern Internet lives. Why is national level procurement still stuck in the stone ages? Buying electronics on the Internet these days involves labourious research online; reading user reviews and using price comparison engines. Why do countries still rely on restricted tender systems to purchase their medicines? </p>

    <p>In a 2010 study of medicine prices for a basket of 50 essential medicines in the Southern African Development Community Region (SADC), it was found that the ratio between the most expensive and the cheapest prices for the same medicines was over 5. This means that one country pays 5 times more than another, for same medicine. In some cases, the ratio was over 50.  </p>

    <p>As part of a <a href="http://www.sarpam.net">larger team</a> working on the SADC pooled procurement policy, Adi, as a consultant to the SARPAM project, is working on the creation of an information sharing platform for medicine prices, suppliers and quality.</p>
    <p>The long-term plan for pooled procurement is to attempt to achieve economies of scale through pooled buying of medicines using combined demand for medicines across all 14 SADC member states. Pooled procurement proper is a long way off, and requires procurement laws to change and policies to adapt. </p>
    <p>In contrast, information sharing is the proverbial low-hanging fruit. Transparency in the prices of medicines purchased in one country can be used by another to strengthen their bargaining power. </p>

    <p>The project is on-going but an early success has shown a $2.5m dollar annual savings on a single medicine in a single country. No change in laws, no bureaucracy, just plain sharing of information. </p>

    <p>What's exciting is that such a mechanism doesn't just apply only to buyers. Making this available to suppliers has the potential to encourage competition amongst sellers of medicines. Once everybody knows what everyone is charging and once everybody knows that everybody knows, over-inflated prices are bound to drop. In a market where a savings of 50c can translate to hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, this project can make a real dent in the burden of disease in one of the world's poorest regions</p>

    <p>Ain't transparency great?</p>
