    <p>Try to track the history of a particular bill in parliament. Do it, we dare you. It's not very easy. The process of making laws is difficult to follow, and the workflow can be extremely confusing. It's difficult to track a bill's history, how it changed and more importantly, the discussions around the change. Only very dedicated researchers are able to piece this puzzle together.</p>
    <p>Code4SA is trying to change all that. Working with the <a href="http://www.pmg.org.za" target="_blank">Parliamentary Monitoring Group (PMG)</a> we are collating all the relevant information in one place. Latest version of the bill? No problem. Audio recordings of discussions by parliamentary committees? Here they are. Changes in the text from one version to another? ... we're working on that. </p>
    
    <p>Bill tracking is always going to be a niche area - we're not expecting the masses to use this tool, but some people will. Researchers, journalists, civil society and industry all need to track the progress of a piece of legislation. This tool will make that a whole lot easier than before. More than that, it lays the ground-work for a whole bunch of interesting around making laws more accessible.</p>
