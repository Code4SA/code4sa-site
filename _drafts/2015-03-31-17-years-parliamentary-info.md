The [Parliamentary Monitoring Group](https://pmg.org.za) have been providing South Africans with insight into the day-to-day details of Parliament since 1995. Being the data geeks that we are, we're incredibly excited that you can now access **over 17 years of Parliamentary data through PMG's API at [api.pmg.org.za](https://api.pmg.org.za)**.
