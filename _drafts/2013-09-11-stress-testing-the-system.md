Stress testing the system
=========================

I'm currenty on a working group developing open data policies for the Western Cape Government and the City of Cape Town. I have been challenging the top-down approach of developing a policy, turning it into law and unleashing it on the world. Rather, I am advocating for a test-driven approach which iteratively test policies in a restricted environments in order to evaluate the implication of policy decisions.

The group agreed to let me test this approach out (possibly just to shut me up) by making initial requests for data and reporting with case studies identifying whether data is available what my experiences have been trying to access it.

So far I have requested information ranging from raw data from a schools survey, progress on public works projects and tender awards in the City of Cape Town. My results have been interesting so far, ranging from a deafening silence to a rejection claiming that my request was "frivolous and vexatious"!. 

The point of this post is to ask a question. What is the primary purpose of requesting this information and how I should go about it. My approach follows this general procedure:

* Search for data to request
* Find the relevant contact and reach out to them (if I can find their details) and politely request the data.
* If I receive a response, it generally goes along the lines of "No" or "Submit a PAIA request" 
* My next step, is to submit the PAIA request and wait a response.
* Often my requests are rejected which kicks in an appeal process.

The rest of the process is boring but my question is this: in my initial request, should I write a long story explaining why my request is in the public interest or should I simply make a polite request without stating my reasons? 

I would like to argue for the latter. According to the Bill of Rights, every citizen has a right to access information held by the State. The Promotion of Access to Information Act fleshes this right out by setting out the process through which a request for information should be made. There are two salient points in the Act that should be noted. Firstly, the Act specifies reasons where a request may/must be rejected. This includes revealing trade secrets of a third party, endangering lives and even rejecting "frivolous and vexatious requests". The second point is that the Act explicitly mentions that reasons for the request are not required and information cannot be rejected on the basis of the requestor's reasons.

Coming back to my point, I don't agree that one needs to create a relationship with a public servant to gain access to data. Often one hears that someone has a friend at this or that government department and were able to access a hard-to-find dataset. I feel that this is a light form of corruption. My personality should not be a factor in whether a request for information is granted or not. My feeling is that it is important to make requests for information, both for the information itself but also to create an awareness within government that access to information is a right.

@justinarenstein disagrees with my approach. He believes that one needs to be a lot more pragmatic. What is important is to release data and make it available for use by citizen hackers and infomediary organisations. Of course he is right but I think my point is important. My first priority is to get the information _in the right way_. Actually getting the data is secondary. Obviously my miltant and puritan approach is not going to win me many friends but I think that it is an important point to make.

My question is, which approach is more likely to yield results - i.e. increasing access to information.
