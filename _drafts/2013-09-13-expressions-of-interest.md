Expressions of Interest for the Code for South Africa fellowship programme
==========================================================================

Code for South Africa is a non-profit organisation working to create a more informed citizenry and to promote active engagement by the public with government at all levels. The media is a pivotal sector with the power to influence public opinion and to provide audiences with tools to respond to happenings in society and to participate in the national dialogue on the issues of the day.

Following the global movement towards finding innovative ways to research and present news, we aim to capacitate journalists to be able to lead in this area.

A growing open-data movement in South Africa is taking shape and core infrastructure is being put in place to improve accessiblity to important datasets such as data from StatsSA, the IEC, municipal demarcations board, government budgets and more. This infrastructure will improve the media's ability to engage in forensic analysis and can be used to provide context to stories that is currently difficult to find. While journalists have been using data to drive the news for over a century, recent advances in technology open the doors towards analysis on a massive scale. Advanced machine learning algorithms are able to search through tens of thousands of documents and are able to find patterns and relationships between entities that were physically impossible before.

Also, a move towards interactive user interfaces on mobile phones and the web can change the way that audiences interact with the media. Previously a broadcast medium, audiences can now engage in a more bilateral relationship with their news.

Already interactive applications are driving previously passive readers to online digital platforms such as the Kenya elections application, "Go to Vote" which helped Kenyans find their nearest polling stations during the previous elections. Before the creation of this application, Kenyans were required to navigate through an inaccessible and complicated document, a task beyond the capabilities of most ordinary people.

Closer to home, an application called "My School", born at a Hackathon in Cape Town gives parents an appreciation of the state of their childrens' schools from student-teacher rations to the state of toilets. Students can also report on issues in their schools using the cameras on their mobile phones.

Code for South Africa is running a fellowship programme to strengthen capabilities within newsrooms as well as to crreate a risk-free environment for media houses to experiment with various approachs to creating innovative information products and tools to publish content.

The programme comprises two models. The first embeds a fellow for 6-8 months in a host organisation. These fellow will be able to wrangle data, write code and work with journalists to develop information products for the purpose of experimentation with various strategies. Fellows salaries will cover covered by Code for South Africa and they will spend 100% of their time in their host organisation for the duration of the contract.

The second model chooses to identify individuals already employed in host organisations with potential. The programme will train them in the skills required to become data-journalists. This model has good potential for long-term sustainability since skills are not lost at the end of the programme period. 

In both models, fellows will be supported by a citizen tech lab, manned by software developers and a graphic designer. This team will provide skills to develop tools and extract information to be used by the news team. In addition, an experienced project manager will work with fellows and host organisations to identify, plan and implement rapid prototypes.

Through this fellowship model, we hope to explore new tools coupled with new revenue models that will drive innovation in the South African media landscape.

We are seeking expressions of interests from though-leader organisations in the form of one-page proposals. These should detail your organisations' vision for how the fellowship programme will complement your existing work. Also include an explanation of your capacity to absorb an embedded fellow or support for an existing staff member. Indicate if your organisation has already embarded on any data journalism projects or produced any applications that you feel correspond to the ethos described in this document.

Submissions deadline is October 15.

We look forward to hearing from you.
