    "Your data or your life" or "Please please please, I beg of you". How to ask for data from government?

Stress testing the system
=========================

I'm currenty on a working group developing open data policies for the Western Cape Government and the City of Cape Town. I have been challenging the top-down approach of developing a policy, turning it into law and unleashing it on the world. I am advocating for a test-driven approach which iteratively tests policies in restricted environments in order to evaluate the implication of policy design.  The group agreed to let me test this approach out (possibly just to shut me up) by making initial requests for data and reporting with case studies identifying whether data is available what my experiences have been trying to access it.

So far I have requested information ranging from raw data from a schools survey, progress on public works projects and tender awards in the City of Cape Town. The results have been interesting so far, ranging from a ignored requests to outright rejection. One response claimed that requests for tender awards was "frivolous and vexatious"!. 

The point of this post is to ask a question about how to approach this task. What is the primary purpose of requesting this information and how I should go about it. My general procedure is as follows:

* Search for data to request
* Find the relevant contact and reach out to them (if I can find their details) and politely request the data.
* If I receive a response, it generally goes along the lines of "No" or "Submit a PAIA request" 
* My next step, is to submit the PAIA request and wait a response.
* Often my requests are rejected resulting in an appeal process kicking in.

The rest of the process is boring but my question is this: how should the original request be phrased? One option is to write a detailed request explaining what the data will be used for and my request is in the public interest. Alternatively, one could simply make a polite request without stating any reasons? 

I would like to argue for the latter. According to the Bill of Rights, every citizen has a right to access information held by the State. The Promotion of Access to Information Act fleshes this right out by setting out the process through which a request for information should be made. There are two salient points in the Act that should be noted. Firstly, the Act specifies reasons where a request may/must be rejected. This includes revealing trade secrets of a third party, endangering lives and even rejecting "frivolous and vexatious requests". The second point is that the Act explicitly mentions that reasons for the request are not required and information cannot be rejected on the basis of the requestor's reasons.

Coming back to my point, I don't agree that one needs to create a relationship with a public servant to gain access to data. Often one hears that someone has a friend at this or that government department and were able to access a hard-to-find dataset. I feel that this is a light form of corruption. My personality should not be a factor in whether a request for information is granted or not. Also, data requests have a secondary purpose. Through requests, an awareness is created within government around the right to information. 

\@justinarenstein disagrees with my approach. He believes that one needs to be a lot more pragmatic. The goal should be to release data and make it available for use by citizen hackers and infomediary organisations. Of course he is right but I think my point is important too. My first priority is to get the information _in the right way_. To me, actually getting the data is secondary. Obviously my miltant and puritan approach is not going to win me many friends but I think that it is an important point to make. 

The ultimate goal is increasing access to information and it seems there are at least two different ways to approach it.
