title: Are traffic fines highway robbery?
excerpt: |
    Traffic accidents in South Africa are a serious cause for concern in South Africa. In 2009, traffic accidents accounted for 31.9 deaths per 100,000 people. Despite this, certain speed traps seem to be engineered to trick drivers rather than aiming to reduce road deaths. I decided to investigate whether municipalities are cynically using fines as an excuse to raise revenue.

Traffic accidents in South Africa are a serious cause for concern in South Africa. Finding accurate data on road deaths is difficult but the [WHO estimates](http://www.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/78256/1/9789241564564_eng.pdf) approximately 14,000 deaths in 2009, accounting for 31.9 deaths per 100,000 people. Despite this, certain speed traps seem to be engineered to trick drivers rather than aiming to reduce road deaths. As January is hangover month when your holiday traffic fines start arriving in the mail, I decided to investigate whether municipalities are cynically using fines as an excuse to raise revenue.

I started with the hypothesis that municipalities on major highways (N1, N2, N3, etc) earn more from fines than other municipalities. The best way to answer that question is to look at the financial reports for each municipality. Thankfully, these reports are standardised by the National Treasury making it easier to find the relevant figures. Below is an excerpt from the report for the nation as a whole.

<img src="/img/traffic-fines/operating-revenue.png"/>

Notice that fines are reported as a revenue stream along with other income sources such as rates, electricity, water and other municipal services. Before continuing, a quick caveat, all of the research in this article refers to this fines line item. It is not exactly clear what percentage of fines are traffic related. While I am making a big assumption that traffic fines (and speeding fines in particular) comprise a large percentage of this figure, I could be completely wrong. I don't think that assumption is too far off the mark though, and hopefully I can convince you of that in the discussion below.

So what do we know about fines nationally? In the 2014 financial year ending June 2014, R1bn in revenue from fines was reported by municipalities. I suspect that this is actual money received by municipalities rather than fines issued. According to [IOL, only 13% of traffic fines are actually paid](http://www.iol.co.za/motoring/industry-news/only-13-percent-of-aarto-fines-paid-1.1558886) so the value of issued fines could be much larger.  On average, fines represent less than half a percent of municipal revenues. The monthly per capita revenue (i.e. for every man, woman and child) from fines is R1.65. Those numbers seem pretty reasonable to me. 

That's the national average. What happens when we focus on national roads only?

Here is what the picture looks like for the N1 from Cape Town to Johannesburg:

Each bubble represents a municipality. The larger the bubble the more that municipality earns from fines relative to the national average. Bear in mind that large municipalities such as the Cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town earn a lot more from fines in absolute numbers. There are simply more motorists to fine. In order to compare municipalities, I normalised in two ways:

Firstly as a percentage of budget. This gives us an idea of how important fines are for the economy of that municipality. 
Secondly, I compared it to the monthly revenue per capita (as before, how much the municipality earns for every man, woman and child in rand terms). It would be better to compare to the number of cars but since I don't have that data, I think that it is a reasonable proxy. This second indicator suggests (in some cases) how much money is earned from out-of-towners. 

The number in the centre of the bubble represents the ratio between the earnings of that municipality to the national average. You'll notice that Laingsburg earns 23 times more (11%) than the national average when comparing as a percentage of revenue and 24 times more (R37.24) when comparing per capita.

The big one of course is Ubuntu municipality, more commonly known as Richmond to those who do the JHB/CPT route. An informal survey of my peer group reveals that the Richmond traffic department sets up cameras in really tricksy places. It's apparently very easy to be caught by their cameras. Fine amounts are often in the thousands, even when driving 20kms over the speed limit [according to Arrive Alive](http://carinsurance.arrivealive.co.za/does-the-national-road-traffic-act-stipulate-the-amounts-for-traffic-fines.php), there is no regulation around fine amounts. A municipality can charge anything they like. A quick search on Google suggests that the municipality is notorius for their traffic fines. Since the municipality is likely to be far away from where you live, it is unlikely that you will defend yourself at the local magistrates court. 

So what is all the fuss about? Well, 26% of the municipality's revenue comes from fines. That suggests that it is considered to be a major source of income. Their population is under 20,000 people so their rates based is pretty low. Revenue needs to come from somewhere. More shocking is that per capita, they earn a monthly figure of R71.28 (58 times the national average). Wow. See what I mean about fines coming in from out-of-towners? It's impossible that that money was earned from fining residents for not submitting their building plans to the municipality or not registering their pets (who does that anyway?). 

What about the other major routes?

I think that these images tell a pretty compelling tale. One thing to notice in particular is the municipalities in the Western Cape seem to earn a bunch more than other muncipalities. Driving through the Eastern Cape seems relatively safe (from a fines point-of-view). 

Okay, let's play devil's advocate. What else could this mean?

Well, firstly, municipalities on major highways are likely to see more traffic than other municipalities so it makes sense that they should earn relatively more money from fines. I'm not convinced, in the N3 example for instance, notice that Lesedi municipality earns way less (R0.15 per capita) than Ekurhuleni (R4.72 per capita) and Midvaal (R11.68 per capita) municipalities despite being sandwiched between them. Logic suggests that vehicles would likely travel across all three municipalities therefore the fine revenue should be more or less similar.

Another argument is perhaps that some municipalities are a lot more efficient at collecting fines than others or that there are conditions in certain places that make speeding more likely. These are real possibilities and I don't really have data to prove this one way or another. Of course, the best data would be a comparison of traffic accidents on every stretch of road. Perhaps these municipalities are really saving lives by reducing accidents. I don't have the data so all I can do is present what I have and let you decide for yourself.

But why is this important anyway. We need to make our roads safer and reduce the number of horrific accidents that are reported in the news every holiday season. If municipalities are really using fines as opportunities to maximise revenue, they are likely setting speed traps in the wrong places. They are not actually incentivised to reduce accidents at all. It would be better to place more cameras in high risk areas. In fact, I would make them highly visible to ensure that drivers slow down. I don't believe that hiding in the bushes and catching drivers unawares is unlikely to make much impact since you often only know that you have been caught when that ominous letter with red writing appears in your postbox.

I don't have a real conclusion here. Hopefully these graphics, at the very least suggest to drivers to be careful in those municipalities regardless of the reason.
