International Open Data Day
===========================

Our first Open Data Day event. Code for South Africa with OKFN-ZA are hosting a data liberation party with lightning talks and a change to roll up your sleeves and get elbow deep into public data in South Africa. 

We're still working out the details but in the meantime, you can register [here](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-South-Africa-Hackers/events/165007242/).
