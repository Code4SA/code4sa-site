If January was a busy month, February was completely outrageous. 21 working days, here is what we achieved:

## Data Journalism Academy
The Code for South Africa data journalism academy was launched. An initial 2-week intensive course was run training journalists to thrust with Excel spreadsheets and parry with data visualisations. Of the 12 who participated, 8 continued after the intensive to join the academy newsroom where they will spend the next 10 weeks gaining real world data journalism experience. The journalists represented the following news outlets: Sunday Times, Business Day, The Daily Dispatch, Financial Mail, Cape Argus, Weekend Argus and Independent media journalism. The 8th student was from the Centre for Film and Media Studies at UCT. Two of the students were offered scholarships for tuition and living expenses.

[Sarah Evans](https://twitter.com/@sarahpeace6) formerly of the Mail and Guardian joined us as a news editor to run the newsroom. We were also fortunate that [Hassel Fallas](https://twitter.com/@hasselfallas), data news editor of La Nacion in Costa Rica joined us for 4 weeks to mentor us on how to run a successful data newsroom.

## State of the Nation
Soon after the newsroom began operating, the [first story](http://mini.iol.co.za/news/sona-as-it-played-out-on-twitter-1985853) about the State of the Nation speech and how it played out on Twitter was published on IOL. In collaboration with [TNS](http://www.tnsglobal.com), 430,000 tweets were used to explore what the Twittersphere thought of the President's speech. The article included this nifty little visualisation:  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.code4sa.org/sona-chord/embed.js"></script>. The star tweet was of the sign language interpretor showing us how to sign "Zupta must fall": <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case anyone was wondering what &quot;Zupta must fall&quot; is in sign language <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SONA2016?src=hash">#SONA2016</a> <a href="https://t.co/l8QgAci2Sq">pic.twitter.com/l8QgAci2Sq</a></p>&mdash; Bryan (@BryanKardash) <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanKardash/status/697852455703470080">February 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

## Vote for the Budget
Through the academy we launched a tool called [Vote for the Budget](http://www.vote4thebudget.org) together with the [International Budget Partnership](www.internationalbudget.org/). Developed as a microsite, its objective was to inform South Africans about their right to make submissions to Parliament about the budget. The tool was released to coincide with the Minister of Finance’s budget speech. It allows users to rank their approval for various decisions incorporated in the national budget. Using these preferences, a template email is generated which is then populated with their answers. Users have the option of sending this email directly to the appropriations committee for consideration. 204 submissions were sent through the site to Parliament’s Standing Committee on Appropriations. It was also published nationally in the following publications:
