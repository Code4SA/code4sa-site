# On a quest for great science stories

On Saturday 22 August, [SciBraai](http://scibraai.co.za/), [Code for South Africa] (http://code4sa.org/) and the [International Center for Journalists (ICFJ)] (http://www.icfj.org/) hosted
the first ever science themed Data Quest, which produced some great potential multimedia
science stories. 

Held at Code4SA’s [Codebridge] (http://www.codebridge.co.za/) lab in Cape Town, the event put data nerds,
scientists and journalists into teams tasked with sifting through publically available data to find
stories and create interactive data visualisations.

Nine teams of three to four participants worked feverishly over the course of the day, with a little
guidance from Code4SA’s resident techies and data journalists. There were many South African
data sets available, including data about South African dams, causes of death, and poverty
levels in South African municipalities. 

Participants had to understand the data, find a story within the data, and then visualise it using
mapping, graphing and statistical analysis. Finally, they had five minutes to present their pitch
for a story to the panel of judges. Raymond Joseph and Adi Eyal of Code4SA, as well as our
very own Anina Mumm, were the judges on the day.

“I’m thrilled with the turnout, especially regarding the science journalists and scientists, all of
whom added really unique skillsets to the Data Quest format,” said Mumm.
“The outcomes also surpassed my expectations ­ all the pitches were excellent so I’m really
proud of the efforts and spirit on the day. Well done to everyone, and a big thank you to the
teams, Jennifer Walker, Raymond, Adi, Jason Norwood­Young and all the techies from
Code4SA for making the day a success!”

Inside, codebridge was buzzing with chatter amid intense concentration while the braai was
sizzling outside in preparation for lunch. (Of course we had a braai. What’s a SciBraai co­event
without a braai?!)

Most participants said that they’ll be taking many lessons home from the day, and they had
really enjoyed working with people from other disciplines. Considering that participants were
randomly assigned to teams, and had only six hours to work together, the final products were
remarkable.

Third place went to [Matthew Barge] (https://twitter.com/bargematt), [Bridget Calder] (https://twitter.com/IHeartLungs), [Shabier Jacobs] (https://twitter.com/shabierj), and Ady Keyser, for a
project that looked at how public transport entrenches inequality in South Africa. [Isaac Lundall](https://twitter.com/isaaclundell),
[Rebecca Weber](https://twitter.com/@rebeccalweber), and [Ashton Maherry](https://twitter.com/amaherry) took second with their tool that shows you where in SA
your water comes from. The winning team of [Wogan May] (https://twitter.com/woganmay), [Joey Reddy] (https://twitter.com/joey_reddy) and [Bibi Aisha Wadvalla] (https://twitter.com/@bb_aisha)
mapped SA hospitals and graded them based on self­assessments to show where SA hospitals
are working and where they are not.
