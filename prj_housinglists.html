project_description: |
    <p>Apartheid, urbanisation and poverty have created squatter camps (shanty towns) all over South Africa. One of the main election promises of the first democratic government was "Houses for all". A worthy goal - but many are still waiting. While in most case there is activity happening in the background: environmental assessments, financial approval, town planning, objections, review of the objections, appeals for rejected objections, ... For many people living in terrible conditions, the bottom line is that they don't have houses. For them, the process has stopped. </p>

    <p>Code4SA is working with the <a href="#">Open Democracy Advice Centre (ODAC)</a> to improve the situation, even if only marginally. Using an experimental and iterative approach, we are providing a simple communication channel between the City of Cape Town and the residents of Red Hill squatter camp. Nothing fancy, nothing too high tech. Just a simple way for the city to update residents and for residents to ask questions.</p>

    <p>We can't change the world, but we're hoping to put one foot in front of the other and provide information about what stage the process is in, contact points for information about services and generally connect recipients with the municipality charged with building houses. In short, treating people like people. </p><p>The experiment is ongoing - watch this space</p>
