project_description: |
    <p>Health care comprises a large percentage of the monthly budget of poor households.  Public health systems are not always able to serve all of the people all of the time despite the best efforts of ministries of health and free health-care systems.</p>
    <p>Imagine taking a day off work to take your sick child to the local clinic. You wait in a long queue at an understaffed facility waiting your turn to be seen by an overworked and underpaid healthcare worker.</p>
    <p>Your child is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. Arriving at the dispensary to receive your medicine, you learn that the medicine is currently out of stock. Moreover, the medicine has not been available for months.</p>

    <p>This is not an unusual situation, it happens to thousands of patients daily throughout Africa. The only option that remains is to visit a private pharmacy to spend a large percentage of your small income on the medicine that your child needs.</p>

    <p>The Tendai project, part of the <a href="http://www.sarpam.net">SARPAM programme</a>, partners with civil society organisations in 6 countries to monitor availability of medicines.</p>
    <p>Approximately 100 community health monitors equipped with inexpensive mobile phones visit facilities on a monthly basis to record the availability of medicines on clinic shelves. Completing questionnaires on their phones, taking photos and geo-locating their clinics, monitors submit this information through cellphone networks to a central server. </p>
    <p>This information is then processed, cleaned and made available to organisations to augment their existing advocacy campaigns with empirical evidence. Adi as a consultant to the programme designed much of the project and continues to maintain the systems.</p>

    <p>Rather than trying to solve a problem, this project aims to work with civil society to support their own advocacy efforts. </p>
    <p>Previously, lobbying was largely local and based on anecodatal evidence. Through the Tendai programme, evidence on the unavailability of medicines is systematically collected and collated. This strengthens arguments and rejects claims of isolated incidents. Data collection on a nationwide basis allows for deeper analysis of causal factors and sets the stage for high-level engagement with ministries of health</p>
    <p>As a result of the Tendai project, community action forms, consisting of organisations focusing on improving access to medicines, are forming in countries to coordinate discussions with government.</p>
