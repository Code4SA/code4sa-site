               <h4>How to get involved in Open Data in South Africa</h4>
                <p>
                Here's some useful information regarding the open data scene in South Africa (apologies for wasting electrons). If you're interested in open data, open government and citizen engagement, subscribe to the mailing lists and keep an eye on the project pages. Coming through to the meet-ups is also recommended so that you can meet others like-minded people.

                <p>The volume on the mailing lists is pretty low so it's worthwhile subscribing to all of them.</p>

                <p>
                If you would like to suggest a community project or join an existing one, have a look at

                <p>If you're looking for data, a good place to start your search is at http://africaopendata.org. We only have a few dozen datasets there at the moment so feel free to add more.</p>
