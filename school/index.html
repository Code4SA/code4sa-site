	  <p>The three-month-long course will consist of a combination of theoretical and hands-on
	     practical work. Participants will spend much of their time each
	     day working in a data newsroom.
	     In addition to data and social media journalism training, the
	     school will also be a centre for news innovation. Through the
	     newsroom, we will experiment with different approaches to
	     delivering content to audiences, with an emphasis on actionable
	     news. Code for South Africa is actively involved in ongoing
	     projects that promote innovation in the media space through the
	     use of data-driven storytelling and the school will play an
	     important role in achieving this.
	  </p>

	  <p>Each intake will consist of up to eight junior to mid-level
	     journalists. They will have the opportunity to gain practical data
	     journalism skill-sets that will equip them to deliver compelling
	     data-driven multimedia stories. The school will be run by a
	     combination of experienced and award winning journalists,
	     coders, data wranglers, analysts and content specialists. Modules
	     will also include specialist topic lectures by high impact guest
	     lecturers from local and international newsrooms.
	     In order to promote data-driven storytelling in South Africa, the
	     course is heavily subsidised by our donors. The price for the
	     course is R18,000 over the three months. Media houses will be
	     responsible for all costs of their trainees, including
	     accommodation and transport. Financial support may be
	     available based on merit.
	  </p>

	  <p>This is a School of Data initiative kindly sponsored by Omidyar
	     Network, Code for Africa, Knight Foundation and the Indigo Trust.
